A link:{vs-url}[VintageStory] mod to recover scrap metal from the smithing
process that would have otherwise gone to waste.

Once a smithing work is completed, the player who completed it will be given the
amount of whole bits that could be formed from the material removed from the
work while it was being crafted.

If a smithing work is completed by a helve hammer, the scrap bits will be
dropped to the floor at the base of the anvil.

== Configuration

The following configuration options are provided in the `thrifty-smithing.json`
file, with default values based on the base VintageStory experience.  Most of
these should not be changed unless necessitated by changes from other mods.

[source, json]
----
{
  "voxelsPerIngot": 42,
  "voxelsPerPlate": 81,
  "materialUnitsPerIngot": 100,
  "materialUnitsPerBit": 5,
  "materialUnitsRecoveredModifier": 1.0,
  "disallowedRecipes": []
}

|===
| Option | Type | Description

| voxelsPerIngot
| `int`
| The number of voxels a single ingot should be worth.

Valid value range: `[1..255]`

| voxelsPerPlate
| `int`
| The number of voxels a single metal plate should be worth.

Valid value range: `[1..255]`

| materialUnitsPerIngot
| `int`
| The amount of material required to craft an ingot.

Valid value range: `[1..65535]`

| materialUnitsPerBit
| `int`
| The amount of material represented by a single metal bit.

Valid value range: `[1..255]`

| materialUnitsRecoveredModifier
| `float`
| Percentage multiplier used to modify the amount of scrap material returned on
completion of a smithing work.

The default value of `1.0` represents `100%`, a value of `0.75` would represent
`75%`, `0.5` for `50%` and so on.

Valid value range: `[0.0..1.0]` (max precision of ~4 digits)

| disallowedRecipes
| array of `string`
| Asset locations for recipes that should not reward any scrap on completion.

For example setting this to `["game:knifeblade-copper"]` would mean that players
are not given any scrap metal back when crafting a copper knife blade.

== Compatibility

* Thrifty Smithing _should_ be compatible with mod-based smithing recipes that
use base game materials.
* Thrifty Smithing _may_ be compatible with mod-based metals, assuming they
provide metal bit items with asset locations matching the base game's
`metalbit-\{material}` scheme.
* Thrifty Smithing is _probably not_ compatible with mods that overhaul or make
significant changes to the smithing system, especially with regard to anvils.
* Thrifty Smithing is _not_ compatible with mods that allow smithing items
without the use of anvils at all (it shouldn't cause a problem, it just won't
give back scrap without an anvil).

| :green_heart:   | https://mods.vintagestory.at/knapster[Knapster v2.x.x] | No issue!
| :green_heart:   | https://mods.vintagestory.at/ancientarmory[Ancient Armory v1.x.x] | Works fine!
| :space_invader: | https://mods.vintagestory.at/amr[Anvil Metal Recovery] | Might work but seems silly.
