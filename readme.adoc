A link:{vs-url}[VintageStory] mod to recover scrap metal from the smithing
process that would have otherwise gone to waste.

Once a smithing work is completed, the player who completed it will be given the
amount of whole bits that could be formed from the material removed from the
work while it was being crafted.

If a smithing work is completed by a helve hammer, the scrap bits will be
dropped to the floor at the base of the anvil.

== Configuration

The following configuration options are provided in the `thrifty-smithing.json`
file, with default values based on the base VintageStory experience.  Most of
these should not be changed unless necessitated by changes from other mods.

[%header, cols="2m,2a,6a"]
|===
| Option | Type | Description

| voxelsPerIngot
| `int`
| The number of voxels a single ingot should be worth.

Valid value range: `[1..255]`

| voxelsPerPlate
| `int`
| The number of voxels a single metal plate should be worth.

Valid value range: `[1..255]`

| materialUnitsPerIngot
| `int`
| The amount of material required to craft an ingot.

Valid value range: `[1..65535]`

| materialUnitsPerBit
| `int`
| The amount of material represented by a single metal bit.

Valid value range: `[1..255]`

| materialUnitsRecoveredModifier
| `float`
| Percentage multiplier used to modify the amount of scrap material returned on
completion of a smithing work.

The default value of `1.0` represents `100%`, a value of `0.75` would represent
`75%`, `0.5` for `50%` and so on.

Valid value range: `[0.0..1.0]` (max precision of ~4 digits)

| disallowedRecipes
| array of `string`
| Asset locations for recipes that should not reward any scrap on completion.

For example setting this to `["game:knifeblade-copper"]` would mean that players
are not given any scrap metal back when crafting a copper knife blade.

== Compatibility

* Thrifty Smithing _should_ be compatible with mod-based smithing recipes that
use base game materials.
* Thrifty Smithing _may_ be compatible with mod-based metals, assuming they
provide metal bit items with asset locations matching the base game's
`metalbit-\{material}` scheme.
* Thrifty Smithing is _probably not_ compatible with mods that overhaul or make
significant changes to the smithing system, especially with regard to anvils.
* Thrifty Smithing is _not_ compatible with mods that allow smithing items
without the use of anvils at all (it shouldn't cause a problem, it just won't
give back scrap without an anvil).

* `Mi` : material per ingot
* `Mb` : material per metal bit
* `Vg` : voxels granted per ingot
* `Vi` : voxels input into the recipe
* `Vr` : voxels required by the recipe

=== Explanation

In base VintageStory it takes 100 units of metal to create an ingot
(`Mi = 100`).  One ingot, when placed on an anvil, grants 42 workable voxels
(`Vg = 42`).  This gives us a material to voxel ratio of 100:42 which means
roughly 2.38095 units of material per voxel.

The returned scrap is measured in whole metal bits, each of which is worth 5
units of material (`Mb = 5`).  Partial bits are not recovered, meaning there is
still some material loss.

The amount of scrap metal recovered after a work is equal to the number of
voxels removed during the crafting process (`Vi - Vr`) multiplied by the
material-per-voxel value divided by the amount of material per bit then rounded
down to the nearest whole number.

As an example we can use a knife blade.  A knife blade requires 17 voxels to
complete (`Vr = 17`).  Assuming the player placed an ingot instead of a metal
plate, that would mean 42 voxels went onto the anvil (`Vi = 42`).  42 input
voxels minus 17 required voxels leaves 25 voxels of scrap metal.  25 voxels
would be worth ~59.5 units of metal, which when divided into bits would give 11
whole bits that can be returned to the player and 0.9 bits
(~4.5 units of material) lost.
